# Contributing to symbolic-intel-core

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project. This repository supports symbolic infrastructure development for trust evaluation, climate intelligence, and AI-governed governance systems.

## Contribution Guidelines

- Fork the repository and create a new branch.
- Describe your changes clearly in the pull request.
- Write clean, modular code with comments and symbolic clarity.
- Prioritize coherence with existing modules (TrustPulse, DriftSentinel, VerithOS, ClimateRail).
- Add tests or examples if adding new functionality.

Symbolic integrity is as important as functionality — contributions that align with the purpose and narrative structure of the system are highly valued.

## Code Style

- Follow PEP8 conventions.
- Use clear docstrings with symbolic notes where relevant.
- Avoid hardcoding values — use configs or environment variables.

Welcome to the forge.
